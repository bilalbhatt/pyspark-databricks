RDD is the resilient distributed data set which is similar to a list in python, it is actually collection of objects. it is distributed over multiple nodes in a cluster.


this is how we can convert a list of tuples to a rdd

data =[(1,"bilal"), (2,"bhatt")]
rdd=spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data)
type(rdd)
